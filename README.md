# react4xp-buildconstants

Generates constants and stores them in a standard JSON file. These constants define the source and target folder structure of a **Reaxt4XP** project, and shared build- and runtime constants needed across its libraries, languages and components.

## Install

NPM or Yarn as usual:
```bash
npm add --save-dev react4xp-buildconstants
```


## Usage

In Node context:
```EcmaScript6
const buildConstants = require('react4xp-buildconstants');
buildConstants(rootDir, outputFile [, overrides])
```

Standalone, from command-line with Node installed:
```bash
node_modules/react4xp-buildconstants/cli.js "rootDir" "outputFile" ["overrides"]
```


### Parameters

`rootDir` (string): the root directory of the React4XP project. Must exist.

`outputFile` (string): the name of the JSON file where the constants are stored. If it doesn't end in `.json`, that extension will be added. It can / should be a full path-and-filename (in system-appropriate format). But if it's only a file name, the output file will be created in `rootDir`. Default behavior is to NOT overwrite the file if it already exists, but overwriting can be enabled (see `overwriteConstantsFile` below). Will try to create folder if path doesn't exist.

`overrides` (optional. Object or JSON-parsable string): Override the default value(s) of output attributes by adding the same key and a new value here. This can be done for each __output value__ specifically, and/or by setting the __base values__ if the output value is derived from one or more common base values. Some but not all base values will be part of [the Output](#output). Overriding base values allow you to control the several output values at once, which can be simpler, more consistent, and safer - recommended. 

Override-able attributes and their default values are:

  - `R4X_HOME = "react4xp"`: Main source code folder, home of core (non-XP-specific) React4xp source code.
 
  - `SRC_MAIN = "<rootDir>/src/main"`: Absolute base source code folder, parent folder of not only `R4X_HOME` but also Enonic XP's `resources` and `java` folders.

  - `R4X_TARGETSUBDIR = "react4xp"`: The target runtime folder, into which React4xp components and runtime stuffs are transpiled                   
  
  - `SUBFOLDER_BUILD_MAIN = "build/resources/main"`: Base pre-JAR folder for building, relative to `rootDir`. Parent folder of `R4X_TARGETSUBDIR`

  - `BUILD_ENV = "development"`: environment variable for production or development
  
  - `LIBRARY_NAME = "React4xp"`: name of the runtime JS library, used for calls in both the client and during serverside rendering 

  - `SITE_SUBFOLDER = "site"`: name of the _subfolder_ (below `<SRC_MAIN>/resources/`) where the Enonic XP site structure is found.

  - `SRC_SITE = "<rootDir>/src/main/resources/site"`: _full path_ to the folder where the XP site structure is found. Derived from `SRC_MAIN + "resources" + SITE_SUBFOLDER`.
  
  - `R4X_ENTRY_SUBFOLDER = "_components"`: name of the _subfolder_ inside the core react4xp folder where react4xp during buildtime will look for general (not bound to specific XP components) _entry files_ (entries are non-shared, first-level components, runnable in both the client and in XP after transpilation)
  
  - `SRC_R4X = "<rootDir>/src/main/react4xp"`: _full path_ to the main react4xp source folder, home of core (non-XP-specific) React4xp source code. Derived from `SRC_MAIN + R4X_HOME`.
  
  - `SRC_R4X_ENTRIES = "<rootDir>/src/main/react4xp/_components"`: _full path_ to the entries source folder. Derived from `SRC_R4X + R4X_ENTRY_SUBFOLDER`.
  
  - `RELATIVE_BUILD_R4X = "build/resources/main/react4xp"`: _relative path_ to the target react4xp build folder. Derived from `SUBFOLDER_BUILD_MAIN + R4X_TARGETSUBDIR`.
  
  - `BUILD_MAIN = "<rootDir>/build/resources/main"`: _full path_ to the main target buildtime folder (pre-JAR). Derived from `SUBFOLDER_BUILD_MAIN`. 

  - `BUILD_R4X = "<rootDir>/build/resources/main/react4xp"`: _full path_ to target folder into which both the React4xp core code and all (both shared and entry) React components will be built. Derived from `BUILD_MAIN + R4X_TARGETSUBDIR`
  
  - `EXTERNALS = { "react": "React", "react-dom": "ReactDOM", "react-dom/server": "ReactDOMServer" }`: externals (non-React4xp, non-vendors) libraries needed to be runtime-available by these names, to both client and react serverside-rendering.

`overrides` can also contain these attributes, which won't change output but adjust behavior when running:

  - `verbose`: Some logging when true
  
  - `overwriteConstantsFile`: Will overwrite already existing output JSON file if true

Slashes depend on file system, should work correctly out of the box. Use your system's appropriate paths when overriding.


## Output

It builds a JSON file with the following attributes, with default or override values. See [parameter overview](#parameters) for the meaning and default value of each of them, as well as rules for overriding. 

  - `BUILD_ENV`
  - `LIBRARY_NAME`
  - `R4X_HOME`
  - `SITE_SUBFOLDER`
  - `SRC_SITE`
  - `R4X_TARGETSUBDIR`
  - `R4X_ENTRY_SUBFOLDER`
  - `SRC_R4X`
  - `SRC_R4X_ENTRIES`
  - `RELATIVE_BUILD_R4X`
  -	`BUILD_MAIN`
  - `BUILD_R4X`
  - `EXTERNALS`
  
In addition, two more attributes are added to the output file. These can't be overridden.
  - `__meta__`: Describing the output file itself
  - `recommended`: Nice-to-have recommended settings (derived from the above) for these other react4xp libraries: 
    - `buildEntriesAndChunks`: react4xp-build-entriesandchunks 
  
A copy of the output file is also put in the predicted build location of the [React4xp runtime lib](FIXME: GET LINK) folder: `<BUILD_MAIN>/lib/enonic/react4xp`
